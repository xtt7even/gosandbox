# Go P2P Sandbox

A small sandbox repo for practicing **Go** by building a **simple DTN peer-to-peer simulation**.

## Goals
This project is for:
- Learning Go
- Researching DTN principles and Store-Carry-Forward Paradigm
- Simulating my ideas
- Twisting my brain a little and escaping skills stagnation

Not production code. Just experiments.

## Progress (08.02.26)
- Peers are displayed on a map, moving randomly across it.
- Peers check signal overlap with neighboring peers - [mobility/simplego.go](mobility/simplego.go)
