# Go P2P Sandbox

A small sandbox repo for practicing **Go** by building a **simple DTN (aka store-carry-forward) peer-to-peer simulation**.

This project is for learning:
- Go basics
- Goroutines and channels
- Simple peer communication

Not production code. Just experiments.

## Run
```bash
go run .
